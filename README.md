========

A python library built off of [cairocffi](http://pythonhosted.org/cairocffi/)
for making images and printed designs. This library is extremely immature.
Don't even bother to clone it unless you are feeling wildly ambitious and
uninhibited.


### drawings folder

The test/examples/quickly hacked scripts are stored in the drawings folder,
where they also output images. I am building this using test-driven
development, in which I write out a script based on the API I wish the library
had, and then I build out the API until it works. These aren't unit tests,
these are visual tests.

### dependencies:

* [cairocffi](http://pythonhosted.org/cairocffi/) (and consequently [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) )
* [geometry](https://github.com/bengolder/python-geometry)
